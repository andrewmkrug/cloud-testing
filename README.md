# Develop Tests in the Cloud

This project aims to demonstrate how to develop Selenium, Cypress, Playwright and any other type of UI test on the most popular Cloud IDEs.

## Why

After running multiple workshops in a variety of settings, I'm beginning to just lean into using cloud-based IDEs since I can have all of the extensions setup in advance and I am not wasiting precious time with machine configurations.

### Perk

The benefit is that if an attendee's company has too many restrictions on the work provided laptop, they can still get a lot of value in the workshop.

The hardest part is getting setup with some of the required libraries.
